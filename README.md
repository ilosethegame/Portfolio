# Portfolio
My portfolio website

Just started working on my portfolio website, so it is a work in progress.  My initial goal is to not only have a functional portfolio website but also to code it in just HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla Javascript.  This is a personal goal, because I have gotten wrapped up in using front-end frameworks and libraries and I don't think all of those extra files and dependencies are necessary for a simple portfolio website.
